# Usage Instructions (also available using the bot's /help command)
- Character Management
  
  You can use the /charactermenu command to access all the options related to managing your characters.
- Initiating a Battle
  
  You can use the /battle command to challenge someone to a character battle. You can also define the setting of the backdrop where you'd like to have your battle in.
  
  Once your opponent accepts the battle invitation, then the challenger must click the Start Battle button to begin.
- Battle Flow
  
  The person who initiated the battle gets the first turn. During battle, you can click on the Move button, where you'll be prompted to input an action. You can only do this if it's currently your turn. Once you submit your action, the AI DungeonMaster will determine the outcome of it, and it becomes your opponent's turn.
